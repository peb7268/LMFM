#LMFM: Lean Mean Fighting Machine | A Mean stack implementation with kick ass attitude.
There are several MEAN stack implementations out there. There is MEAN.io & MEAN.js among other.
These are great. To me, a lot of the solutions out there either feel overly complicated, unfocused, 
or their methodology seems murky. As I learn the stack myself, I wanted to provide a way for others to learn also. Thus I am creating this guide. 

As I created it though, I thought, if im going to be reinventing the wheel anyway, why not invent it the way I want.
So this project will be an implementation focusing on several key things.  

1. Current Technologies ( browserSync, socket.io, ect.. )
2. Swappable Template Engines
3. Horizontal application structure

**Note this project is a work in progress**
